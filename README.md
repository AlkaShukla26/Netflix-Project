## 💡 Recommendations
1. **Boost Regional Content**
   - Korean shows already performing well internationally.
   - Adding **200–300 more K-dramas yearly** could strengthen global dominance.

2. **Genre Diversification**
   - Heavy focus on Drama & Comedy.  
   - **Underrepresented genres (Sci-Fi, Thriller, Kids)** → Untapped opportunity.

   - Increasing this could attract **household subscriptions**.

4. **Sustain Growth Strategy**
